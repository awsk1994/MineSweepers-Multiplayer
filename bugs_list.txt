=== BUGS/STORY ===

>> HIGH:

>> MID:
 - instructions should be collapsable

>> LOW:
 - actual content of instructions

>> FOR LATER:
 - clicking on the first tile should initialize it to zero and then reveal surrounding ones... so the user doesnâ€™t need to keep clicking until it hits something. 
 - mobile support


=== BIG STORIES ===
 - multiplayer -> needs to communicate with server.
 - info page
 - highscore
 - UI enhancement
