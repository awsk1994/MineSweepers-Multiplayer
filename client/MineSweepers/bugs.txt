To Improve:
 - button is not really in the middle in action-solo/multi
 - combine action solo/multiplayer into one.

Bug:
 - submit highscore option after game won.

 Todo:
  - Progress bar needs to be dynamic.
  - Move gameboard into the middle.
  - submitScore (empty call in modal.component)
  - UI Upgrade
  
Considerations:
 - instead of having action-solo/multiplayer, let's have a chat... either global chat (of all users in this application) or peer chat (if in multiplayer mode). And then, move restart/surrender to difficulty place.
