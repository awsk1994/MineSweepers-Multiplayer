To Improve:

Bugs:

 Todo:
  - chat (heading tab: switch between global and game left...)
  - database setup for submit score.
  - submit score http request.
  - Use jQuery to detect changes in things.
     - footer should be semi-transparent when screen doesn't fit everything. When screen fits all, then should expanded footer (with About Me and Contact)
  - multiplayer
  - type up how to play (w/ screenshot)

Considerations:
 - have different size tiles depending on difficulty (board size).

UI enhancement:
1. Header has two buttons, they are all centered middle, but slightly off. Need to use grid and make them exactly symmetrical looking.
2. Color consistency. Choose 4-5 colors, and apply them consistently. Now, there are like white and green-ish white.etc...
3. Think about the bomb color, and the flagBomb progress bar... if it makes sense.
4. Might want to consider changing the color scheme? Black-orange looks like pornhub.
5. Make responsive; especially the tiles.
