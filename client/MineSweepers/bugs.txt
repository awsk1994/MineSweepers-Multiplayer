To Improve (high):
  - socket: keep alive?
  - keep track of user connect/disconnect on server.. is it doing it correctly?


To Improve (mid):
   - highscore:
     - filter by name
     - should fetch top 10, and then click to load more.
     - UI enhancement:
       - create filter by username.. and add search icon
   - room:
     - create room should be using form.
  - room, rooms, request name....
     - should perhaps make this a route? (eg. /mutliplayer/:difficulty, :roomId)
  - soloCompoennt's display room, rooms.etc.
     - should perhaps make it a number 0,1,2, each representing the different room, rooms.etc.
  - header
     - UI: displaying username.

Bugs:
 - when localStorage's nickname is removed, the requestname will pop up and block the game. Should pause the game and continue game after submitted nickname.

Todo:
   - room chat works... but should the joinroom be called in constructor or onInit of SoloComponent? Better if onInit.
   - switchMap :: look into it. Should we use it?
   - how to leave room? : should detect hyperlink changes and leave room.
   - should add how many unack chat messages badge next to "global chat and room chat button"

  - enter room:
     - require planning...
     - change room list to a different hyperlink: BASE_URL/multi/rooms
     - change each room to a hyperlink: BASE_URL/multi/rooms/:roomId
     - req name modal will happen on a higher zIndex
     - room model in db needs 'users' and 'state'
     - how to increase/decrease occupancy.

  - chat:
     - Try to implement chat per rooms
     - (DONE) Understand when a user connects/disconnects
     - (DONE) Understand socket room functionality for socket.io.
     - (LATER) Entering nickname should save it in localstorage (can set expire day?)
     - (LATER) need to store chat record in db. When refresh, should fetch last n chat record. Normally, just keep socket open and append to list. If possible, better to refresh with db every n minutes.
     - understand observables.
     - temp: can send message to rooms...
  - chat UI 
     - (todo later) heading tab: switch between global and game left
     - hover over the header to see list of users
     - (todo later) layover for adding username and server not found
     - date listing for the chat
     - hit enter to submit... 
     I prefer (keydown.enter)="mySubmit()" because there won't be added a line break if the cursor was somewhere within a <textarea> but not at its end.

  - Use jQuery to detect changes in things.
     - footer should be semi-transparent when screen doesn't fit everything. When screen fits all, then should expanded footer (with About Me and Contact)
  - type up how to play (w/ screenshot)


Todo (future):
1. turn to phone app
2. make website okay when browser size shrink
3. Local storage save username so don't need to ask username again between Solo and multiplayer and chat ask name.

Next Project?:
1. Google+, Facebook.etc login
2. Pass tokens... so can remember 


Considerations:
 - have different size tiles depending on difficulty (board size).
 - maybe make the website just whole page and then scale everything based on view height and width... no scroll...
 - changing DB? mongodb is not a relational database...! mySQL or presGre? or firebase? Only store chat with mongodb?
- room list lists all the rooms regardless of difficulty, and then you can filter it if you want? or maybe display all with subheading?

UI enhancement:
2. Color consistency. Choose 4-5 colors, and apply them consistently. Now, there are like white and green-ish white.etc...
3. Think about the bomb color, and the flagBomb progress bar... if it makes sense.
4. Might want to consider changing the color scheme? Black-orange looks like pornhub.
5. Make responsive; especially the tiles.
6. Minesweeper title can be made better.
7. title (in google chrome tab) and icon are not set.
8. animations


Notes on Socket (2017/07/04):
1. Go to server folder, and run npm start
2. Go to client and npm start
3. Go to localhost:4200 (for client)
4. go to localhost:3000 (for client as well... but we'll act as a mock client chat)
