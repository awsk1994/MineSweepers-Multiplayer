To Improve:
   - highscore:
     - filter by name
     - should fetch top 10, and then click to load more.
     - UI enhancement:
       - create filter by username.. and add search icon
Bugs:
 - when you change link, the socket disconnects, but doesn't re-connect.

 Todo:
  - socket not working whenever I don't use debugger mode.
  - rooms:
     - create room
  - db: need to have delete somewhere...
     - create a room UI (select bar dropdown for difficulty)
     - Create a room form and submit stuff

  - chat:
     - understand observables.
     - add: add nickname thing (<request-name></request-name>... check soloService for existing. If none, then ask. (apply this to when multiplayer is firstlyclicked).
  - chat UI 
     - heading tab: switch between global and game left
     - hover over the header to see list of users
     - layover for adding username and server not found
     - date listing for the chat
     - hit enter to submit... 
     I prefer (keydown.enter)="mySubmit()" because there won't be added a line break if the cursor was somewhere within a <textarea> but not at its end.

  - send highscore not working...
  - database setup for submit score.
  - submit score http request.
  - Use jQuery to detect changes in things.
     - footer should be semi-transparent when screen doesn't fit everything. When screen fits all, then should expanded footer (with About Me and Contact)
  - multiplayer
  - type up how to play (w/ screenshot)


Todo (future):
1. turn to phone app
2. make website okay when browser size shrink
3. Local storage save username so don't need to ask username again between Solo and multiplayer and chat ask name.

Next Project?:
1. Google+, Facebook.etc login
2. Pass tokens... so can remember 


Considerations:
 - have different size tiles depending on difficulty (board size).
- maybe make the website just whole page and then scale everything based on view height and width... no scroll...

UI enhancement:
2. Color consistency. Choose 4-5 colors, and apply them consistently. Now, there are like white and green-ish white.etc...
3. Think about the bomb color, and the flagBomb progress bar... if it makes sense.
4. Might want to consider changing the color scheme? Black-orange looks like pornhub.
5. Make responsive; especially the tiles.
6. Minesweeper title can be made better.
7. title (in google chrome tab) and icon are not set.
8. animations


Notes on Socket (2017/07/04):
1. Go to server folder, and run npm start
2. Go to client and npm start
3. Go to localhost:4200 (for client)
4. go to localhost:3000 (for client as well... but we'll act as a mock client chat)
