To Improve:

Bugs:

 Todo:
  - chat  
     - heading tab: switch between global and game left
     - hover over the header to see list of users
     - layover for adding username and server not found
     - date listing for the chat
     - hit enter to submit... 
     I prefer (keydown.enter)="mySubmit()" because there won't be added a line break if the cursor was somewhere within a <textarea> but not at its end.

  - database setup for submit score.
  - submit score http request.
  - Use jQuery to detect changes in things.
     - footer should be semi-transparent when screen doesn't fit everything. When screen fits all, then should expanded footer (with About Me and Contact)
  - multiplayer
  - type up how to play (w/ screenshot)

Considerations:
 - have different size tiles depending on difficulty (board size).

UI enhancement:
2. Color consistency. Choose 4-5 colors, and apply them consistently. Now, there are like white and green-ish white.etc...
3. Think about the bomb color, and the flagBomb progress bar... if it makes sense.
4. Might want to consider changing the color scheme? Black-orange looks like pornhub.
5. Make responsive; especially the tiles.
6. Minesweeper title can be made better.
7. title (in google chrome tab) and icon are not set.
8. animations
