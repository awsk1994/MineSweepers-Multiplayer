To Improve:
 - button is not really in the middle in action-solo/multi
 - combine action solo/multiplayer into one.

Bug:
 - submit highscore option after game won.

 Todo:
  - gameOver messsage
  - after gameOver, should have message... click to start game.
  - submitScore (empty call in modal.component)
  - UI Upgrade
     - footer should be at bottom if page doesn't overflow
     - header/footer UI.
     - add instructions icon -> click to open modal with instructions
  - chat

Considerations:
 - instead of having action-solo/multiplayer, let's have a chat... either global chat (of all users in this application) or peer chat (if in multiplayer mode). And then, move restart/surrender to difficulty place.
