=== NEXT TIME ===
 - instructions should be collapsable

=== BUGS/STORY ===

>> HIGH:
 - Should have a set number of bombs for each size of board
 - actual content of instructions

>> MID:
 - decide on 3-4 hard coded sizes

>> LOW:
 - instructions is collapsable, but not animated. try to make it animated?

>> FOR LATER:
 - clicking on the first tile should initialize it to zero and then reveal surrounding ones... so the user doesnâ€™t need to keep clicking until it hits something. 
 - mobile support (shrink/re-arrange appropriately)
 - take care of overflow (when board size too big, or browser window too small)


=== BIG STORY ===
 - multiplayer -> needs to communicate with server.
 - info page
 - highscore
 - UI enhancement
